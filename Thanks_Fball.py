    Collects points of each player using espn.com and joins player points to member dictionary DataFrame

    Notes:
         - scoringPeriodID in url is week
         - startIndex corresponds to which 50 players are gathered (0=top 50, 1=51-101, etc.) 
         - BeautifulSoup is used to parse the url
         - <tr> tag defines a row in an HTML table; a <tr> element contains one or more <td> elements
         - <td> tag defines a standard cell in an HTML table
         - Function selects all <tr> elements after the first 3 tables (player info starts with 3rd table)
         - Function then selects all text in a standard cell (<td> elements) for the player tables selected
         - Columns that are unnecessary are dropped
         - Only player name is grabbed by splitting on comma
         - Function loops through all startIndexes avaiable
         - Scores are joined to member dictionary
         - Scores are aggreagted and reported with leader_board()
