Thanksgiving fantasy football draft and scoring code

Every year during Thanksgiving, my family has a fantasy football draft. We only include the teams that are playing on Thanksgiving and limit the positions to draft in order to keep it simple. This has become a holiday tradition and been a nice distraction from the amount of calories I consume at the dinner table.

A few things to note, the code is written in python (3.5) and uses the urlib.request and bs4 libraries. There is also a pseudo-draft section that I used to personally check the code. The player scores are grabbed from ESPN and columns are manipulated in order to return desired plater stats.
