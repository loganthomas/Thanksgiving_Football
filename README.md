# Thanksgiving Football Repo

> Thanksgiving fantasy football draft and scoring code.  
>> Every year during Thanksgiving, my family has a fantasy football draft.  
>> We only include the teams that are playing on Thanksgiving and limit the positions of the draft in order to keep it simple. This has become a holiday tradition and been 
>> a nice distraction from the amount of calories I consume at the dinner table.  

>> A few things to note:
>> - The code is written in python (3.5) and uses the urlib.request and bs4 libraries.
>> - There is a pseudo-draft section that I used to personally check the code. The player scores are grabbed from ESPN and columns are manipulated in order to return desired plater stats.
